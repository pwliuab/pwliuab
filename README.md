- 👋 Hi, I’m Paul

- 🌱 I’m currently learning algorithm through <a href="https://leetcode.com/DeathNote/">leetcode</a>

- 📫 I'm currently reading Operating System Three Easy Piecesz ^ ^.
- I have constructed a React Native App for wheelchair user to play games, it includes game guidance function, QR code scanning function and timer function. What's more is that, a React Admin web platform for admin to manage game resources are built by me which allows admin to CRUD resources including pictures, QR code and text easily. For the user experience, I have added Drag and drop function for uploading.

- I have also created a React Native android App for music conversion management. This is an App allows user to convert their MP4 files easily to MP3 format. They can even just share youtube link to the app for music conversion. In an addition, they can create a playlist in the app and listen to the songs anywhere and anytime.
